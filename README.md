# Mobile-First Responsive Layout

This project was Project #2 as part of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree. The project incorporates mobile-first design using HTML and CSS. In this project, I created the HTML and CSS based on a mockup for a small screen size, then with the help of min-width media queries, I created the layout to accommodate medium and large screen sizes.
